What is abstraction?
Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features or functionalities of an object or system. It focuses on what an object does, rather than how it does it. This principle helps streamline development by allowing programmers to interact with simpler, user-friendly representations of complex systems.

Why is abstraction important?
Abstraction is essential because it reduces complexity and enhances code readability and maintainability. It enables developers to design systems in a modular way, fostering reuse of components, easier debugging, and scalability. For example, in large-scale projects, abstraction separates different layers (e.g., user interface, business logic, data storage), making the system more organized and flexible to changes.

A benefit of abstraction
A significant benefit is the ability to create reusable code. For instance, in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), abstract classes and interfaces define common functionalities, allowing multiple classes to implement them while maintaining their unique implementations. This reduces code duplication and ensures consistency across the system.

An application of abstraction
One practical application of abstraction is in the development of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). APIs provide developers with a way to interact with a system without needing to know its internal workings. For example, you might use an API to send an email or fetch weather data, and the abstraction ensures that you donâ€™t need to know the technical details behind these processes.
using System;

// Abstract class
abstract class Animal
{
    public abstract void Speak(); // Abstract method with no implementation
}

// Concrete class 1
class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The dog barks.");
    }
}

// Concrete class 2
class Cat : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The cat meows.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        Animal myCat = new Cat();

        myDog.Speak(); // Output: The dog barks.
        myCat.Speak(); // Output: The cat meows.
    }
}
